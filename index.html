<p>iRaccoonShow enables the creation of presentations that include slides with synchronized sound. One presentation (re)created with iRaccoonShow is <a href="http://www.free-culture.tk">http://www.free-culture.tk</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, your favourite screencast software can be used to record a presentation. But such a video cannot beat the presentations generated by iRaccoonShow in two different areas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>File size: each slide image is include only once in the final presetation.</p></li>
<li><p>Image quality: vector images allow higher resolutions without higher file sizes.</p></li>
</ul><p>Digital video requires to include the same image many times per second. This is a huge waste of unrequired size. And when the number of images per second is decreased, audio can loose sync with images.</p>

<p>But even if the slide could be included only once for its full display time, its image would have a given resolution. Image size in video cannot increased without decreasing its definition. Maybe a higher resolution could be set in some cases, but the resulting file would be higher.</p>

<p>iRaccoonShow includes each image only once in the presentation, preserving each resolution–independent image as such.</p>

<h2>
<a name="tools" class="anchor" href="#tools"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tools</h2>

<p>There are two main tools in iRaccoonShow:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>recslides</code> records the sound to a file and writes the slide transitions to a text file, while displaying the slides at full screen.</p></li>
<li><p><code>iraccoonshow</code> generates the final Flash presentation and loader from the PDF file, the sound recording and the time transitions.</p></li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="warning" class="anchor" href="#warning"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Warning</h2>

<p>Just in case you wonder and before further reading: I cannot code. My background isn’t technical and I have never learned programming. Sorry, but I must confess it’s too complex for a simple mind such as mine <img class="emoji" title=":smirk:" alt=":smirk:" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/smirk.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle">.</p>

<p>What I have done here could be considered trial–and–error writing. It works for me, but it is full of glitches. I’m aware of the limits of iRacconShow, but I cannot overcome them.</p>



<h2>
<a name="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h2>

<p>iRaccoonShow has the following dependencies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python: was the original script language of RaccoonShow, from what iraccoonshow evolved.</li>
<li>GTK, PyGTK: minimal GUI.</li>
<li>Poppler: PDF display.</li>
<li>GStreamer, PyGST: audio recording.</li>
<li>SWFTools: generation of Flash files.</li>
</ul><p>iRaccoonShow is a command–line software. In <code>recslides</code>, command–line is only used to invoke the tool (after that, there is no command–line <img class="emoji" title=":wink:" alt=":wink:" src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/wink.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle">).</p>

<p>It only works on Linux. I’m not saying that it cannot be ported to other platforms: this is something still to be done.</p>

<h2>
<a name="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How It Works</h2>

<h3>
<a name="recslides" class="anchor" href="#recslides"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><code>recslides</code>
</h3>

<p><code>recslides</code> records the sound from the microphone and registers each slide transition timing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It’s invoked in the command–line with something like <code>recslides mypresentation.pdf</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>A new window is opened, displaying the first slide from presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>When the mouse is single-clicked for the first time , presentation goes to full screen and sound from microphone starts to be recorded in a sound file (something like <code>mypresentation-audio.wav</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Each time the mouse is clicked, presentation advances to next slide and the transition time is recorded to a text file (named such as <code>mypresentation-times.txt</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>When the last slide is reached and the mouse is clicked, presentation leaves full screen and audio recording is stopped. It takes 2.5 seconds extra to avoid problems with the Flash generation.</p></li>
</ol><p>With <code>recslides</code>, you obtain both the recorded sound and transition times from each slide in presentation. This means you have two key features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Having the transition times and sound, you can generate the final presentation in the format you like (being Flash only one of the possible ones <a href="#flash">more on this</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>This is the best (or maybe the only possible) way to get accurate transition times. Times are recorded when giving the presentation (not necessarily in public), not recreated by calculating how long each slide took.</p></li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="%C3%ACraccoonshow" class="anchor" href="#%C3%ACraccoonshow"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><code>ìraccoonshow</code>
</h3>

<p><code>ìraccoonshow</code> should be cleared before it can be released to the public (<a href="https://github.com/ousia/iRaccoonShow/issues/1">read the issue</a>).</p>

<h2>
<a name="bugs" class="anchor" href="#bugs"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bugs</h2>

<p>Of course, this simple piece of software has bugs. I cannot code, so you can <a href="https://github.com/ousia/iRaccoonShow/issues">report issues</a>. But if you can contribute code, issues will be fixed earlier.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<h2>
<a name="compatibility-issues" class="anchor" href="#compatibility-issues"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compatibility issues</h2>

<p>I think there are two main areas in with compatibility issues might arise: iRaccoonShow as the tool and Flash as the output format.</p>

<h3>
<a name="iraccoonshow-1" class="anchor" href="#iraccoonshow-1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>iRaccoonShow</h3>

<p>Porting iRaccoonShow to Windows and MacOSX isn’t impossible, but this is beyond my technical skills.</p>

<p>My guess is that it may be easier to write these tools with native libraries for those platforms. At least, the libraries for PDF display and audio recording. But this is only a(n educated?) guess.</p>

<p>SWFTools works out–of–the box in Windows. And it may be installed in MacOSX (using <a href="https://www.macports.org/install.php">MacPorts</a> or even <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> [the latter seems harder to install]).</p>

<p>I run Linux on my machine. So, even if I had something designed for Windows or MacOSX, I wouldn’t be able to check it on these platforms.</p>

<h3>
<a name="flash" class="anchor" href="#flash"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flash</h3>

<p>Flash is available for Windows, MacOSX and Linux. iPad isn’t supported, since Apple doesn’t want to have it supported.</p>

<p>Linux has a Flash player, but its development has stopped in version 11.2 (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplatform/whitepapers/roadmap.html">security fixes will be added for five years after this release</a>).</p>

<p>Since Flash is a dead project in Linux, there are two other possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Generate a movie with variable frame–rate. Image quality with the <a href="http://www.vp9videocodec.com">VP9 codec</a> seems to be the best available. And audio can be much compressed with a higher quality using the <a href="http://www.opus-codec.org/">Opus codec</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>PDF can be a good format for vector–based presentations. It only requires some multimedia JavaScript and a PDF reader implemented by Adobe.</p></li>

<a name="acknowledgments" class="anchor" href="#acknowledgments"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>Well, I gratefully acknowledge that I stand on the shoulders of many giants:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lawrence Lessig gave the original talk at the O’Reilly Open Source Conference in 2002.</p></li>
<li><p>Leonard Lin created the first Flash presentation and posted it <a href="http://randomfoo.net/oscon/2002/lessig/">online</a>. (Originally released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.)</p></li>
<li><p>Matthias Kramm develops <a href="http://swftools.org/">SWFTools</a>, a GNU GPL software that makes all the Flash generation.</p></li>
<li><p>Jono Bacon developed <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/files/raccoonshow-0.6.tgz">RaccoonShow</a>, the first tool that enabled the recreation from a Flash file  from PDF slides and recorded video. (Released under the GNU GPLv2 license. Abandoned project.)</p></li>
<li><p>Sergio Costas developed <a href="http://www.rastersoft.com/programas/supershow.html">SuperShow</a>, which allows the user to recreate a presentation from a video file and the slides in PDF format. (Released under the GNU GPLv3 license. Abandoned project.)</p></li>
<li><p>I recreated the original presentation and posted it <a href="http://www.free-culture.tk">online</a>. Thanks to the improvements to SWFTools by Matthias Kramm, the original file was decreased in a 27% smaller size. I couldn’t have done that without the help of Matthias Kramm, Sergio Costas, Chris Pugh, Ricardo Pedroso and Huub Schaeks.</p></li>
